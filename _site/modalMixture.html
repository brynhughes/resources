<h1>Modal mixture</h1>

<p><em>Modal mixture</em> (also called <em>modal borrowing</em>) refers to the use of chords belonging to a parallel key—for example, a passage in F major incorporating one or more chords from F minor. Note that, like with the use of applied chords, this does not necessarily constitute modulation. Only a cadence can confirm a new key. Without a cadence in a new key, the non-diatonic chords are simply &quot;borrowed.&quot;</p>

<p>Note that the use of the leading-tone in place of the subtonic, or a melodic-minor figure (<em>sol–la–ti–do</em>) in a minor key does <em>not</em> constitute modal mixture. Those are considered &quot;native&quot; to the minor mode.</p>

<h2>Thoroughbass notation</h2>

<p>A chord borrowed from the parallel major or minor will take the same thoroughbass figure as the &quot;native&quot; chord. However, it will require at least one chromatic alteration (flat, natural, sharp, or slash). Be careful to account for abbreviated figures: a 4/3 figure, for example, is short for 6/4/3. If the sixth above the bass is altered, that needs to be included in the figure (just like in a French augmented sixth chord, or a D2 chord in minor).</p>

<h2>Functional bass notation</h2>

<p>Chords borrowed from parallel keys are chromatically altered chords, and therefore their functional bass symbols should be enclosed in square brackets. For example, if an <strong>S4</strong> chord in major is borrowed from the parallel minor (<em>fa–le–do</em> instead of <em>fa–la–do</em>), the functional bass symbol is <strong>[S4]</strong> not <strong>S4</strong>. If the bass note is not altered, this is the only change to the functional bass (but be sure to alter the thoroughbass figure as well).</p>

<p>If the bass note is chromatically altered, that must be reflected in the functional bass with a plus or minus before the numeral (as well as the square brackets). For example, if a passage in a major key incorporates a 5/3 chord over <em>le</em> (<em>le–do–me</em> instead of <em>la–do–mi</em>), the functional bass is <strong>[Tx–6]</strong>.</p>

<h2>Roman numeral notation</h2>

<p>When the root of a borrowed chord belongs to the home key (e.g., using an E-minor chord instead of an E-major chord), the Roman numeral remains the same, since the Roman numeral simply represents the scale-degree of the chordal root. For example, if a piece in minor ends with a <em>Picardy third</em> (a major tonic triad), the Roman numeral is still <strong>I</strong>. (The thoroughbass will be altered to reflect the chromatic change.)</p>

<p>If the root is altered relative to the home key, use a flat or sharp in front of the Roman numeral to designate the alteration: flat to designate <em>lowered</em> (that is, a semitone below normal), sharp to designate <em>raised</em> (a semitone above normal). For example, a <em>le–do–me</em> chord in a major key is bVI. (Again, alter the thoroughbass as necessary.)</p>
