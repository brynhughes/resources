                <h2>Introduction to this "textbook"</h2>


<div class="post">
<p>This website is a still-growing, online &quot;textbook&quot; for students at the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami. Textbook is in scare quotes because this is neither a book, nor entirely comprised of text. But it is the main source of information, and the main resource for student reference, in the theory curriculum.</p>

<p>This website is meant to accompany classes that are largely dedicated to active learning. Students are meant to only occasionally engage these resources as the first step in learning a new concept or skill. Rather, these resources are usually meant to follow an earlier stage of analysis or inquiry, or a study of models to be emulated. As a result, most of the pages on this site do not read like a textbook. This is on purpose. Instead, the text is designed to be easily referenced while performing a task—such as model composition or inquiry-based analysis. This necessitates short, pithy prose rather than elaborate, masterful exposition.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a book to read that will teach you music theory or musicianship skills independently, this probably will not work. It is designed with a particular kind of class in mind, which is collaborative and for which this is only a supplemental resource to the primary pedagogical tool—active engagement with the materials in the presence of peers and a professor.</p>

<h3>Who wrote this, anyway?</h3>

<p>Much of the content hosted here was originally written by Kris Shaffer. The material was &quot;forked&quot; by Bryn Hughes, who has since modified Shaffer&#39;s content, and added much of his own. It is an open-source textbook with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.</a></p>

<h3>Open source</h3>

<p>This &quot;textbook&quot; is an <em>open-source</em> textbook. That means that you are free to use, modify, distribute, even sell its contents provided that you 1) attribute the original to its author(s), and 2) pass on the same rights to others (which includes the original author(s)!) by licensing your derivative work in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the same way</a>. In fact, others are highly encouraged to &quot;hack&quot; this book: supplement it, reword it, add examples, drop chapters, mash it up with another one. This will result in a greater diversity of material available, which in turn will make this resource better, too.</p>

<p>If you want to &quot;fork&quot; this textbook, either to deploy it for your own course without worrying its content changing (this website is still very much a work-in-progress, after all), or to use it as the basis for your own derived work, click &quot;View on Github&quot; <a href="https://github.com/brynhughes/resources">here</a>, log in (or sign up), and &quot;fork&quot; the project. From there, you can edit, add, or remove the text, graphics, and videos (all text is in the very user-friendly Markdown format), or the theme (HTML and CSS). You can also send me a &quot;pull request,&quot; if you&#39;ve made a change you think would be beneficial to add to this version. You can even download an individual file to convert into a Word document and distribute as a handout in class.</p>

<p>Happy reading, watching, and hacking!</p>
