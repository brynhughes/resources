{{ page.title }}
================

The most common chromatically altered subdominant chords (aside from the applied dominant of V) are the *Neapolitan chord* and the various *augmented-sixth chords*.

Neapolitan chord
----------------

The Neapolitan chord contains lowered scale-degree 2, along with scale-degree 4, and lowered scale-degree 6: *ra*, *fa*, and *le*. It is a major triad, and it usually appears with *fa* in the bass (first-inversion), which is also doubled in a four-voice texture. It's designation is **N6**. 

In a Roman numeral analysis, **N6** substitutes for a Roman numeral (that is, it is not a flat-II chord). In a functional bass analysis, **N**. is placed below the functional designation of **[S4]**.

Augmented-sixth chords
----------------------

Augmented-sixth chords are so named because of the augmented sixth that occurs between *le* and *fi*, the two scale-degrees that are present in every augmented-sixth chord. The other pitch(es) in the chord determine which kind of augmented-sixth chord is present. 

The *Italian augmented-sixth chord* is the simplest augmented-sixth chord, with only three members: *le*, *do*, and *fi*. *Le* is typically the bass note, and in a four-voice texture, *do* is typically the pitch that is doubled. When *le* occurs in the bass, the functional designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we also label the chord **It.** In a Roman numeral analysis, just **It.** will do. The figured bass is a simple slashed "6." 

The *French augmented-sixth chord* has four members: *le*, *do*, *re*, and *fi*. As in the Italian sixth, *le* is typically the bass note, and the functional designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we label the chord **Fr.** In a Roman numeral analysis, just **Fr.** will do. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a "4" and a "3." 

The *German augmented-sixth chord* has four members: *le*, *do*, *me*, and *fi*. As in the other augmented sixth chords, *le* is typically the bass note, and the functional designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we label the chord **Ger.** In a Roman numeral analysis, just **Ger.** will do. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a "5." The German sixth is almost always followed by a cadential 6/4 chord. 

The *Swiss augmented-sixth chord* has four members: *le*, *do*, *ri*, and *fi*. This chord is named "Swiss" because it sounds German but is spelled like the French. (*ri* in place of *me*) (Switzerland is a mixture of German-, French-, Italian-, and Romansch-based languages and cultures, with German and French being the largest.) *Le* is typically the bass note, and the functional designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we label the chord **Sw.** In a Roman numeral analysis, just **Sw.** will do. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a slashed "4" and a "3."
